## How to Use
Take a photo with your camera, the system will tell you which genre she thinks this shot is. 
Then, you can enter your album's name and generate your album cover! Enjoy.

## Why to Use
Because musicians are bored and album cover designers are overrated.

## Some DEEP Philosophy
You will soon find out basically everything is Indie, unless it's jazzy.
Metal is really hard to achieve, and I sincerely hope nothing metal would appear in your webcam.

#### We only do Indie, Jazz and Metal. Yeah, sue me.

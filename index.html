<h1>Album Cover Generator</h1>
<p>This is a magical Album Cover Generator</p>
</br>
<p>Take a photo with the camera on your laptop, phone, etc., and she will tell you which genre that photo belongs! She can also help you generate your own music album cover.</p>
<p>FYI: She only listens to Indie, Metal and Jazz. Apologies for Hip hop fans out there. </p>
<p>Fun fact: Her favorite genre is Indie!</p>
